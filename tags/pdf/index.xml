      <description>I was recently emailed a bunch of JPEG files of a scanned document. There was a file for every page, and the image files were very large. I wanted to get them all in a single PDF file on letter size paper. Because I find PDF mystical and difficult to work with, I decided to stick to tools I know - and I know LaTeX.
In no time I learned how to use the ImageMagick tool convert to convert to PDF.</description>
